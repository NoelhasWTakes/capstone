      Claim Statement 1: Our infrastructure has been contructed around using fossil fuels as the primary way of producing energy and currently have no other plans to switch away from it in the U.S

     Evidence #1: (1)“oil is plentiful and the technology to extract it continues to improve, making it ever-more economic to produce and use” 
     (2)“overall it planned to pump 25 percent more oil and gas in 2025”
     
     <div class="col border border-1 border-secondary container my-3 text-light">
      Explanation #1: (1)The oil companies are attempting to not stop pumping oil which would not only cause more pollution but it would also grow the oil industry which would lead to more companies pumping more oil.
      (2)We have advanced so much in oil extraction that it is so much more cost effective to use oil than to change to anything else. Not only that there are almost 0 substitutes for oil because it wouldn’t be cost effective for everyone.

      Evidence #2: (1)“the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization has said about 14% of all emissions come from meat and dairy production” (2)“Grazing animals require a lot of land, which is often cleared through the felling of forests”
      

      <div class="col border border-1 border-secondary container my-3 text-light">
        
      Explanation #2: (1)Having to cut down forests lowers the amount of oxygen production made by trees. (2)14% of global emissions come from the meat industry due to gastrointestinal gasses released from cows and other farm animals.

  Implication #1: We can slowly transition towards nuclear power slowly within the next 22 years or else it will become to late
