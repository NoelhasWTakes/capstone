      Claim Statement 1: At the moment there is no substitute for fossil fuels

      Claim Statement 2: The meat industry has a high conturibution towards Carbon Dixode being exposed to the atmosphere

     Evidence #1: (1)“oil is plentiful and the technology to extract it continues to improve, making it ever-more economic to produce and use” 
     (2)“overall it planned to pump 25 percent more oil and gas in 2025”
     
     <div class="col border border-1 border-danger container text-light">
      Explanation #1: (1)The oil companies are attempting to not stop pumping oil which would not only cause more pollution but it would also grow the oil industry which would lead to more companies pumping more oil.
      (2)We have advanced so much in oil extraction that it is so much more cost effective to use oil than to change to anything else. Not only that there are almost 0 substitutes for oil because it wouldn’t be cost effective for everyone.

    <div class="col border border-1 border-danger container my-3 text-light">
      Evidence #2: (1)“the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization has said about 14% of all emissions come from meat and dairy production” (2)“Grazing animals require a lot of land, which is often cleared through the felling of forests”
      

      <div class="col border border-1 border-danger container my-3 text-light">
        
      Explanation #2: (1)Having to cut down forests lowers the amount of oxygen production made by trees. (2)This also means that trees aren’t using the CO2 so more of it is going into the atmosphere. 14% of global emissions come from the meat industry due to gastrointestinal gasses released from cows and other farm animals.

  Implication #1: We can slowly transition towards nuclear power slowly within the next 10 to 20 years to help out and stop pumping as much gas.
  Implication #2: We can become vegans to slow down cow production so there is less gas being out
